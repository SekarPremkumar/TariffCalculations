# Tariff Calculator for Shipping Companies

## Configuration Snippet

This section controls how the tariff calculator behaves during execution.
Adjust these values based on your environment and setup:

    are_you_running_code_first_time = True
    Set to True if you're running the script for the first time.
    This will parse the document, create embeddings, and build the vector index.
    Set to False if you want to reuse a previously created index (for faster execution).

    file_path = ""
    Path to your local or cloud-hosted tariff document (PDF or text format).

    llama_cloud_api_key = ""
    API key for accessing LlamaParse (used to parse document content).

    openai_api_key = ""
    API key for calling OpenAI or Azure OpenAI models.

    azure_endpoint = ""
    Azure OpenAI-specific endpoint, e.g., https://<your-resource-name>.openai.azure.com/.

    api_version = ""
    Azure OpenAI API version, e.g., 2023-05-15.

    model = ""
    Model name, e.g., gpt-4 or the name of your deployed Azure OpenAI model.

Make sure these values are filled out before execution. They control whether new embeddings are generated, which model is used, and how your documents are processed.


## Technical Explanation

### Document Parsing
Used **llamaParse** for parsing the tariff documentation.

### Embedding Creation
Used **HuggingFace Sentence Transformer** model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to generate embeddings.

### Vector DB
Used **FAISS DB** to store and retrieve embedded document sections.

## How I Approached Tariff Calculations

### Inputs:
We have two main inputs:
1. **Tariff Documentation**
2. **Vessel Details**

From these inputs, we need to:
- Identify the **correct section of the document** for each tariff type
- Understand how the **tariff is to be calculated**
- Match this with **vessel details** to determine the applicable tariff and perform the calculation

### Key Challenge:
The main challenge is ensuring the model understands the **nuances of the shipping industry**, including:
- Deep understanding of the document
- Strong context and **geographical awareness** (e.g., knowing that "registered port" means a South African port in this context)

### Importance of Retrospection:
Since accurate interpretation is critical, I used a **series of prompt chaining** steps to guide the model logically.

## Step-by-Step Prompt Strategy

1. **Understand the Relevant Document Part**
   - Extract and convert it into a **clearly defined instruction manual** of how to approach the problem.

2. **Create Logical Questions**
   - Generate condition-based yes/no questions that must be answered to perform the calculation.

3. **Answer the Questions**
   - Using the **vessel details**, have the model answer each logical question with yes/no to determine which rules apply.

4. **Enrich Vessel Details**
   - Add **contextual awareness** and **geographical understanding** to enhance the raw vessel data.

## Final Step: Calculation Using Smol Agents
With the following:
- Detailed instructions
- Context-enriched vessel details
- Logical questions and answers

I used **Smol Agents**, a code-based agent that accurately performs **mathematical calculations** by working directly with code.

## Final Output Example:
```json
{
  "light dues": 60062.04, // <Correct>
  "port dues": 309853.1115,
  "towage dues": 7053752.976, // <NoInfoInDocument>
  "vehicle traffic services (VTS) dues": 33345.0, // <Correct>
  "pilotage dues": 51300.0,
  "running of vessel lines dues": 1654.56
}
```

## My Thoughts and Observations on the Result and Solution:
- I have tried my best to address the problem and come up with a **solid framework** to approach it.
- The solution **covers most important aspects**.
- It **misses a few edge cases due to time constraints of this assignment**, such as:
  - What if **no information is available** in the document?
  - Other potential **exception scenarios**

### Examples:
1. **Working hours issue:**
   - For `pilotage dues`, there was **no mention of working hours** in the document, so the model made a wrong assumption.

2. **Towage dues:**
   - Info related to this calculation was **not present in the document**, so the output was incorrect.

3. **Other inaccuracies:**
   - Sometimes the LLM gives wrong output even though everything seems fine â€” usually due to **improper understanding of the instruction**, which I believe can be improved using **prompt tuning**.

## Summary
This is how I approached the problem and built a logical, structured framework for calculating tariffs based on real-world documentation.
